<h1 align="center">COIN BASED MOBILE CHARGER</h1>
<p>The coin based mobile charging system charges the mobile phones when the coin is inserted. The coin acceptor recognizes valid coins and then signals the arduino  for further action. If a valid coin is found, it signals the arduino and then starts the mobile charging mechanism.</p>
